  "recommendations": [
    "Missing Divisions: Ensure parser extracts all 4 main divisions (IDENTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENT, DATA, PROCEDURE) as separate entities",
    "Missing Sections: Improve section detection regex patterns to capture all section definitions, including those with numbers",
    "Missing Paragraphs: Review paragraph validation logic and ensure all paragraph definitions are captured, not just PERFORM statements",
    "Missing Statements: Add comprehensive statement extraction for all COBOL verbs (DISPLAY, MOVE, IF, PERFORM, etc.)",
    "Implement hierarchical parent-child relationships between entities",
    "Add line number preservation for better debugging",
    "Create entity validation to avoid duplicates",
    "Add support for nested paragraph structures",
    "Implement statement-level granularity for detailed analysis"
